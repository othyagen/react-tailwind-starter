# ðŸ§ª How to Use `react-tailwind-starter` Template

This guide shows how to create a new React + Tailwind project using your GitHub template:

GitHub Template: [https://github.com/othyagen/react-tailwind-starter](https://github.com/othyagen/react-tailwind-starter)

---

## âœ… Option 1: Create in a NEW folder

Use this when you want to create a fresh project in a new directory:

```bash
npx degit othyagen/react-tailwind-starter my-new-project
cd my-new-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will create:

```
your-folder/my-new-project/
```

With the full project inside.

## âœ… Option 2: Create in the CURRENT folder

Use this if you're already inside an **empty folder** and want the template there:

```bash
npx degit othyagen/react-tailwind-starter .
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Important:**  
Make sure the folder is empty, or existing files might be overwritten.

## ðŸ’¡ Tip: Start a fresh git repo

After cloning, you can start version control:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Now you have a clean project based on your template, ready to build something awesome!
